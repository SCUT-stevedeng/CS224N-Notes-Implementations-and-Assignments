    "P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)=P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2)...P(w_n|w_1,w_2,...,w_{n-1})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}P(w_t|w_1,w_2,...,w_{t-1})\n",

    "An early statistical language model is the **n-gram model**. It assumes that the nth word is dependent only on the preceding n-1 words to make probability computation feasible. For example, a bi-gram model use one preceding word to predict the next word, a tri-gram model uses two preceding words to predict the next word...\n",

    "### 2.1 A fixed-window NLM\n",
    "It follows the convention of n-gram---predict the nth word given preceding n-1 words. Word vectors are concatenated into a window vector. And it receives the window vector, processes it with an MLP and outputs softmax probabilities over the entire vocabulary. However, one big problem of this model is that it cannot handle variable sequence length dependency. So we'll see RNN.\n",

    "### 2.2 RNN\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Model Structure\n",
    "RNN is like a reusable MLP. An RNN receives two inputs every step. We input a vector $x_1$ (it can be the first word vector of a sentence), and initialise a hidden state $h_0$ (usually a zero vector), take their respective affine transformations $W_{xh}x_1$ and $W_{hh}h_0$, and then plus a bias $b_h$, sum them up, we get $W_{xh}x_1+W_{hh}h_0+b_h$. And then we apply an activation function $\\Phi$, we get $\\Phi(W_{xh}x_1+W_{hh}h_0+b_h)$. This is what we use to compute the current hidden state $h_1$. To get an output of the current time step, just do an affine transformation with $h_1$ and add a bias $b_o$, apply an activation function. We can do this calculation recurrently: input $x_2$ (the second word vector of a sentence), load $h_1$...... This is how an RNN works. The main maths are as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h_t=\\Phi(W_{xh}x_t+W_{hh}h_{t-1}+b_h) \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say we are doing a Next-Word-Prediction task and we have a huge corpus starting with \"the students opened their exams\". When we input \"the\", we get the prob of the next word. However, we don't choose the most probable word as the next input. Instead, we input the ground truth \"students\". This is called \"teacher forcing\", aiming to avoid error accumulation, et cetera. And then input \"opened\"... Every prediction, we compute a loss. In practice, we don't just run through the entire corpus and compute all losses. It's too computationally expensive. Rather, we split the corpus into sentences( or documents), put them into batches. In a batch of sentences, losses of words of different sentences are computed in parallel. To do backprob, we compute the average losses of every sentence i.e., $\\frac{loss_{w1}+loss_{w2}+...}{num\\_words}$, then average the sentence-level losses, i,e., $\\frac{loss_{s1}+loss_{s2}+...}{batch\\_size}$, finally do mini batch gradient descent. Well, this is equivalent to averaging the losses of all tokens in a batch, which is what we in practice do.<a id=\"one\"></a>\n",

    "As you can see from the formula (1), the length of matrix mulplication chain is O(t), which is prone to causing gradient instability problems. For gradient vanishing, there's no general solution. But for gradient exploding, we have **Gradient Clipping**. The main idea is: Put all gradients into a long one dimensional vector $g$, calculate its L2 norm, which reflects the magnitude of the overall gradient. If it's too large, clip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we have gradient matrices: $\\partial W_{xh}$, $\\partial W_{hh}$ and $\\partial W_{ho}$ (biases not considered for simplification). We take all gradient values to form a vector $g$ in the shape of (x*h+h*h+h*o), calculate its L2 norm $||g||$. Next we compare this value with a threshold $\\theta$. $||g||$ being larger than $\\theta$ means that gradients need to be clipped(scaled). We scale $g$ by $\\frac{\\theta}{||g||}$. If not, we do nothing or just consider $\\theta$ to be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing so, we scale down exploding gradients to relatively moderate values. So $g$ are the gradients with which we do weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Comtemplation**:Can batch normalization be applied between the time steps of an RNN? My idea is based on the fact that gradients closer to the loss function are less affected by gradient vanishing and exploding. In MLPs, this issue can be alleviated by adding batch normalization layers between the fully connected layers. So, in an RNN, can batch normalization be added between time steps to alleviate this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: not batch norm, but layer norm. And Layer Norm can alleviate both gradient vanishing（mainly） and gradient exploding(slightly).\n",
    "\n",
    "But overall, the most effective way is to abandon RNN and turn to LSTM.\n",

    "##### Sequence Tagging\n",
    "This includes part of speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, etc. For example, input \"The startled cat knocked over the vase\", output their part of speech (DT, JJ, NN, VBN, IN, DT, NN)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sentiment(Text) Classification\n",
    "Normally, we can connect RNN hidden states of all time steps to an nn.Linear producing an output for each time step. But if we only want one output such as the probability vector, we connect the last hidden state of the last time step to an nn.Linear. Yet, there is a usually better way, which takes advantage of hidden states of all time steps. We take the hidden state vectors, and apply a function such as mean or max to pool the them so that we get one vector, and then put it into an nn. Linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Language Encoder\n",
    "The hidden states of RNNs are encoded features of input sequences. We can employ them to do many other tasks such as machine translation, question answering, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signal(Feature) Decoder\n",
    "Decode features of signals. For instance, input audio signals, and use RNNs to decode them into sequences of words; decode the encoded features in tasks like machine translation, summarization, etc. This is the concept of conditional langauge model."

    "text='''Some of the most important decisions of our lives occur while we are feeling stressed and anxious. From medical decisions to financial and professional ones, we are all sometimes required to weigh up information under stressful conditions. But do we become better or worse at processing and using information under such circumstances? My colleague and I, both neuroscientists, wanted to investigate how the mind operates under stress, so we visited some local fire stations. Firefighters' workdays vary quite a bit. Some are pretty relaxed; they will spend their time washing the truck, cleaning equipment, cooking meals and reading. Other days can be hectic, with numerous life threatening incidents to attend to; they will enter burning homes to rescue trapped residents, and assist with medical emergencies. These ups and downs presented the perfect setting for an experiment on how people's ability to use information changes when they feel under pressure. We found that perceived threat acted as a trigger for a stress reaction that made the task of processing information easier for the firefighters - but only as long as it conveyed bad news. This is how we arrived at these results. We asked the firefighters to estimate their likelihood of experiencing 40 different adverse events in their life, such as being involved in an accident or becoming a victim of card fraud. We then gave them either good news (that their likelihood of experiencing these events was lower than they'd thought) or bad news (that it was higher) and asked them to provide new estimates. People are normally quite optimistic - they will ignore bad news and embrace the good. This is what happened when the firefighters were relaxed; but when they were under stress, a different pattern emerged. Under these conditions, they became hyper-vigilant to bad news, even when it had nothing to do with their job (such as learning that the likelihood of card fraud was higher than they'd thought), and altered their beliefs in response. In contrast, stress didn't change how they responded to good news (such as learning that the likelihood of card fraud was lower than they'd thought). Back in our lab, we observed the same pattern in students who were told they had to give a surprise public speech, which would be judged by a panel, recorded and posted online. Sure enough, their cortisol levels spiked, their heart rates went up and they suddenly became better at processing unrelated, yet alarming, information about rates of disease and violence. When we experience stressful events, a physiological change is triggered that causes us to take in warnings and focus on what might go wrong. Brain imaging reveals that this 'switch' is related to a sudden boost in a neural signal important for learning, specifically in response to unexpected warning signs, such as faces expressing fear. Such neural engineering could have helped prehistoric humans to survive. When our ancestors found themselves surrounded by hungry animals, they would have benefited from an increased ability to learn about hazards. In a safe environment, however, it would have been wasteful to be on high alert constantly. So, a neural switch that automatically increases or decreases our ability to process warnings in response to changes in our environment could have been useful. In fact, people with clinical depression and anxiety seem unable to switch away from a state in which they absorb all the negative messages around them. It is also important to realise that stress travels rapidly from one person to the next. If a co-worker is stressed, we are more likely to tense up and feel stressed ourselves. We don't even need to be in the same room with someone for their emotions to influence our behaviour. Studies show that if we observe positive feeds on social media, such as images of a pink sunset, we are more likely to post uplifting messages ourselves. If we observe negative posts, such as complaints about a long queue at the coffee shop, we will in turn create more negative posts. In some ways, many of us now live as if we are in danger, constantly ready to tackle demanding emails and text messages, and respond to news alerts and comments on social media. Repeatedly checking your phone, according to a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association, is related to stress. In other words, a pre-programmed physiological reaction, which evolution has equipped us with to help us avoid famished predators, is now being triggered by an online post. Social media posting, according to one study, raises your pulse, makes you sweat, and enlarges your pupils more than most daily activities. The fact that stress increases the likelihood that we will focus more on alarming messages, together with the fact that it spreads extremely rapidly, can create collective fear that is not always justified. After a stressful public event, such as a natural disaster or major financial crash, there is often a wave of alarming information in traditional and social media, which individuals become very aware of. But that has the effect of exaggerating existing danger. And so, a reliable pattern emerges - stress is triggered, spreading from one person to the next, which temporarily enhances the likelihood that people will take in negative reports, which increases stress further. As a result, trips are cancelled, even if the disaster took place across the globe; stocks are sold, even when holding on is the best thing to do. The good news, however, is that positive emotions, such as hope, are contagious too, and are powerful in inducing people to act to find solutions. Being aware of the close relationship between people's emotional state and how they process information can help us frame our messages more effectively and become conscientious agents of change.This finding also has direct implications for our everyday lives. First, it reminds us to be especially cautious when making important decisions under stress. While stress can heighten our sensitivity to potential threats, this heightened awareness is not always beneficial—it can lead us to over-focus on negative information, overestimate risks, and underestimate opportunities. For example, in financial investments or career choices, stress may push us to avoid reasonable risks or overreact to low-probability events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, it suggests that we can actively manage our emotional state to improve information processing. Short relaxation exercises, deep breathing, mindfulness meditation, or talking with friends can reduce stress levels and help the brain return to a more balanced mode, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of information. Conversely, when facing real danger or urgent threats, stress can act as a protective mechanism, enabling rapid recognition of hazards and quick action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this mechanism plays a significant role in group behavior. Not only are we affected by our own stress, but we are also highly influenced by the emotional state of others. This means that in organizations, public communication, or even family life, the stress levels of leaders or key influencers can quickly spread, amplifying panic or hope. Being aware of this, we can strategically manage how information is presented—for instance, providing clear, calm guidance during crises while emphasizing solutions rather than just warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this research highlights a fundamental truth: human neural mechanisms are highly adaptive, designed both to protect us from real dangers and, in modern society, sometimes to overreact to virtual threats. Understanding this system makes it clearer how emotions, stress, and information processing interact to influence decision-making, allowing us to manage both personal behavior and social dynamics more effectively. By consciously regulating our emotions and environment, we can reduce unnecessary fear while harnessing the beneficial aspects of stress to respond more effectively to genuine challenges.'''"

    "\n",
    "The key lies in the \"+\" sign in $C_t$(LSTM) and $H_t$(GRU). Similar to Residual Connection (ResNet, Kaiming He), the \"+\" provides a term that has relatively stable gradients. In ResNet, the term is x, whose derivative is always 1. In LSTM, the term is $F_t \\odot C_{t-1}$, whose derivative $F_t$ is between 0 and 1, while in GRU it is $U_t \\odot H_{t-1}$, following the same principle. In contrast, vanilla RNNs (the most basic RNNs) don't have such a stable path for gradients to flow. "
