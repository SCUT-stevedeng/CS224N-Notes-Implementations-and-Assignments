    "## Language Modelling\n",
    "Language Modelling is modelling the probability of a sequence: \n",

    "P(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)=P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2)...P(w_n|w_1,w_2,...,w_{n-1})=\\prod_{t=1}^{T}P(w_t|w_1,w_2,...,w_{t-1})\n",

    "An early statistical language model is the **n-gram model**. It assumes that the nth word is dependent only on the preceding n-1 words to make probability computation feasible. For example, a bi-gram model use one preceding word to predict the next word, a tri-gram model uses two preceding words to predict the next word...\n",

    "But with n-gram model, we generate grammartical but incoherent texts that don't make sense. So let's see neural language models.\n",

    "### A fixed-window NLM\n",
    "It follows the convention of n-gram---predict the nth word given preceding n-1 words. Word vectors are concatenated into a window vector. And it receives the window vector, processes it with an MLP and outputs softmax probabilities over the entire vocabulary. However, one big problem of this model is that it cannot handle variable sequence length dependency. So we'll see RNN.\n",

    "### RNN\n",
    "#### Model Structure\n",
    "RNN is like a reusable MLP. An RNN receives two inputs every step. We input a vector $x_1$ (it can be the first word vector of a sentence), and initialise a hidden state $h_0$ (usually a zero vector), take their respective affine transformations $W_{xh}x_1$ and $W_{hh}h_0$, and then plus a bias $b_h$, sum them up, we get $W_{xh}x_1+W_{hh}h_0+b_h$. And then we apply an activation function $\\Phi$, we get $\\Phi(W_{xh}x_1+W_{hh}h_0+b_h)$. This is what we use to compute the current hidden state $h_1$. To get an output of the current time step, just do an affine transformation with $h_1$ and add a bias $b_o$, apply an activation function. We can do this calculation recurrently: input $x_2$ (the second word vector of a sentence), load $h_1$...... This is how an RNN works. The main maths are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "h_t=\\Phi(W_{xh}x_t+W_{hh}h_{t-1}+b_h) \\\\\n",
    "o_t=\\phi(W_{ho}h_t+b_o)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",

    "#### Training an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are doing a Next-Word-Prediction task and we have a huge corpus starting with \"the students opened their exams\". When we input \"the\", we get the prob of the next word. However, we don't choose the most probable word as the next input. Instead, we input the ground truth \"students\". This is called \"teacher forcing\", aiming to avoid error accumulation, et cetera. And then input \"opened\"... Every prediction, we compute a loss. In practice, we don't just run through the entire corpus and compute all losses. It's too computationally expensive. Rather, we split the corpus into sentences( or documents), put them into batches. In a batch of sentences, losses of words of different sentences are computed in parallel. To do backprob, we compute the average losses of every sentence i.e., $\\frac{loss_{w1}+loss_{w2}+...}{num\\_words}$, then average the sentence-level losses, i,e., $\\frac{loss_{s1}+loss_{s2}+...}{batch\\_size}$, finally do mini batch gradient descent. Well, this is equivalent to averaging the losses of all tokens in a batch, which is what we in practice do.<a id=\"one\"></a>\n",

The main idea is: Put all gradients into a long one dimensional vector $g$, calculate its L2 norm, which reflects the magnitude of the overall gradient. If it's too large, clip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we have gradient matrices: $\\partial W_{xh}$, $\\partial W_{hh}$ and $\\partial W_{ho}$ (biases not considered for simplification). We take all gradient values to form a vector $g$ in the shape of (x*h+h*h+h*o), calculate its L2 norm $||g||$. Next we compare this value with a threshold $\\theta$. $||g||$ being larger than $\\theta$ means that gradients need to be clipped(scaled). We scale $g$ by $\\frac{\\theta}{||g||}$. If not, we do nothing or just consider $\\theta$ to be 1.\n",
